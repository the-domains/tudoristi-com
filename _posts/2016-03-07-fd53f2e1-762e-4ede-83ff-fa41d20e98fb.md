Having been interested in watches for the early age of 12 when i bought my first swatch chrono. Since then i have evolved and bought and sold a few watches and now have a small collection which mainly 
focuses on Tudor and Panerai. Other brands have come  and gone but these
two brands have been in the watchbox for the last few years.

In the end of 2002 i bought a titanium Panerai and at the same time discovered Paneristi.com. It was a place solely devoted to Panerai's but that was not what drew me to that website, it was the way the people exchanged information and were enthousiastic, that made me read the post of the public forum almost on a daily bases. Since that time I also bought  a Tudor watch and because i could not find a website with the same  kinda fanbase so i decided to start Tudoristi.

I hope we can make this a place to exchange information and share our enthousiasm of the Tudor watches.
